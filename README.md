# Simple Java Client-Server
A basic client-server application built in Java for learning computer networks. The server listens on a specified port and echoes messages back to the client. The client sends user-input messages and exits gracefully with the "exit" command. Features TCP-based communication using `Socket` and `ServerSocket`, with a looped message-handling system.
